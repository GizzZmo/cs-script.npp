v1.7.28
- Patched NppPluginNet: `CharacterRange.cpMin` and `CharacterRange.cpMax` changed from `int` to `IntPtr`
  This addresses the problems triggered by this the third-party component (NppPluginNet):
  - Issue #64: Creating a new script crashes latest 64-bit Notepad++ release
  - Issue #65: Intermittent crashes (and the culprit is CS-Script)
- Added transparent switching to the new NPP API depending on the version: v8.2.1<->v8.3.1 (triggered by #64 and #65)
- Added logging syntaxer internal errors to the plugin log dir.
